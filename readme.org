You are not American and you are tired of spelling your name when ordering pizza?
Type a name and find yourself an American name!

I can't say it worked really well, but it was fun.

Most popular names for the last 100 years were used (from
http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi). For the name similarity measure, I
tried couple of different things, like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance][edit distance]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance][Jaro-Winkler distance]].

This is purely based on string similarity. A much better implementation can be based
on pronounciation.

Thanks to Doga for html/css/js part.
